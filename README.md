# Tool Description

This is a dynamic Python ETL script that connects to a Postgresql database RDS instance in AWS and creates a database/schema from a folder of flatfiles (.csv, .xls, .xlsx format only).
This script is packaged as an executable with a basic UI enabling users to run it from their local machine and select the folder of files they want.
